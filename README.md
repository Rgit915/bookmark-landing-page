 ## ðŸ“Œ My Process

I started by structuring the layout using React components and Tailwind CSS for styling. I focused on building a responsive design that works well on both small and larger screens. After setting up the base components (Hero, Features, Download, Contact, etc.), I worked on interactivity such as:

- Tabbed slides with different content per tab
- FAQ toggle behavior (expand/collapse answers)
- A validated contact form with real-time error states

---

## âœ… What I Learned

- âœ… **Email validation in React** using controlled inputs and regular expressions
- âœ… **Managing component state** using `useState` to show/hide error messages and slide contents
- âœ… **Conditional rendering** of icons, input styles, and messages
- âœ… **FAQ toggle functionality** using active index logic to open/collapse answers

---

## ðŸš€ Continued Development

Going forward, I plan to:

- Improve **accessibility** with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Integrate form submission to an actual backend or third-party service (e.g., Formspree or Firebase)
- Add **animations** to FAQ toggles and tab content transitions using Framer Motion
- Implement unit tests for the form and toggle logic
